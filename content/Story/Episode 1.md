We start our adventure roughly a year since the formation of [[The Swill Shell Pirates]] by its founding members, [[Captain Estefin Swill]], and his crew of adoptive siblings from [[Mother Sue's Orphanage for wayward children]], [[Tik' Nik']] and [[Don Maishell]], as well as a cheery sea elf looking to escape the binds of commitment named [[Merri Lightningbolt]]. The crew is currently docked on the north west side of [[Six Piers Island]] their home turf.

[[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] caught word from a dock worker on the east side of the island that [[The Marines|the marines]] were moving a large chest from the island to somewhere in the [[The Grand Line|Grand Line]].

The crew planned to ambush to marines at sea and guise themselves as a fishing crew just off the island near [[pier 1]] where the marine's vessel was waiting for its payload.

Meanwhile [[Captain Estefin Swill|Estefin]] and [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] decided to try to gain travel with the Marines to try to get on the inside. They went with cross dressing as women and flirting with the sailors in order to convincing them to let them travel on board with them to another island. This attempt however failed and [[The Marines|the marines]] seemed to only be focused on their own business at hand.

After this failed effort [[Captain Estefin Swill|Captain Swill]] and [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] headed into the water to ride in tow with the marine vessel. [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] was hiding underneath the marine vessel with his ability to breath under water, while [[Captain Estefin Swill|the Captain]] used some pieces of kelp to hide just above the waters surface.

After some time [[The Marines|the marines]] left port at [[Six Piers Island]] heading to some unknown location in the [[The Grand Line|Grand Line]] and were hastily followed by [[Old Dorothy]] and it's current crew of first mate [[Don Maishell]] and fisherman extraordinaire [[Tik' Nik']].

Once [[The Marines|the marines]] got a few miles out from the island the crew began their attack initiated by [[Don Maishell|Don]] unloading cannon fire at the marine vessels hull in an attempt to make a hole large enough to board. Meanwhile in the commotion [[Captain Estefin Swill|Estefin]] and [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] made their way up the back of the ship from the water as [[Don Maishell|Don]] attempted to harpoon [[Old Dorothy]] in tow of the marine ship.

Shortly after [[Tik' Nik']] made his way on board and began raging through a number of marine soldiers, while [[Captain Estefin Swill|the Captain]] and [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] snuck below deck into the crew corridors and attempted the disguise act once again but this time as marine soldiers.

The captain and Merri soon found themselves face to face with Vice Admiral Shiro. He seemed to not be fooled by the disguises as he mentions to the group that only one other person on board was allowed entry into this room. The battle soon erupted as [[Tik' Nik']] fended off numerous marines despite being vastly outnumbered, [[Don Maishell|Don]] was barraging the marine vessel with cannon fire and quick maneuvers with [[Old Dorothy]].

Meanwhile below deck stood [[Captain Estefin Swill]] and [[Merri Lightningbolt]] face to face with an elite marine officer. The battle was not an easy one as [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] nearly drew his last breath before almost miraculously through sheer will he brought himself back to his feet nearly dead but unshaken and ready to end this. However his will would not be enough this time as [[Vice Admiral Shiro]] downed him once again and threw down his lit cigar into a pile of grease created by [[Captain Estefin Swill|Estefin]] as he stepped into the flame and attempted to grab [[Captain Estefin Swill|the Captain]] and take him down with him, however [[Captain Estefin Swill|Captain Swill]] was too quick and [[Vice Admiral Shiro|Shiro]] dies burned alive where he last stood.

The crew quickly finish off the rest of the marine soldiers and commandeer the vessel and it's treasure for themselves. In the aftermath [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] recovers however slightly, and begins opening the large treasure chest the marine soldiers had been transporting from [[Six Piers Island]].

Upon picking the lock and opening the chest [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] discovers a slightly smaller locked chest inside somewhat like a nesting doll. Merri then attempts to remove the chest only to trigger a trap on the bottom of the inner chest going down once again though is quickly brought to by his captain who was standing near by.

Upon opening the remaining of the nested chests (3 in total) they found a strange looking pink fruit resembling a banana.
