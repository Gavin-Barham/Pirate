We open to [[The Swill Shell Pirates]] beaten and worn from their recent scuffle and aboard their newly commandeered marine ship in open waters. The crew decide they should hurriedly make their way back to [[Six Piers Island]]and hide out for a while at a much lesser used port.

With a relatively easy journey back they find themselves docked at [[pier 6]] and seemingly alone for now. [[Captain Estefin Swill|Captain Swill]] and [[Don Maishell|Don]] head into town for supplied to fix up their new vessel from the recent battle scars as well as find some more deckhands to man the large war ship. Though their first stop was to visit [[Mother Sue]] and see if she might have any older boys in willing to work aboard their ship.

Meanwhile [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] heads to the crew corders to get some much needed rest after the fight, and [[Tik' Nik']] with his lack of a need to sleep spends his time fishing and gathering food for the next journey.

However [[Mother Sue]] and the others at [[Mother Sue's Orphanage for wayward children]] are unaware that the young men she raised are actually working as pirates as they color their words to give the surface level appearance as a merchant/fishing crew.

[[Mother Sue]] tells [[Captain Estefin Swill|Estefin]] and [[Don Maishell|Don]] that she does have one child in mind, he just turned 15 and tends to be the victim of local bullies. She tells the crew that doing some manual work to get stronger and gain some self confidence will be good for him, as well as getting him away from said bullies for a bit. The crew now hesitant to bring a 15 year old boy on board to a pirate ship begrudgingly accepts [[Mother Sue]] offer.

[[Mother Sue]] then reintroduces the crew to [[Young Ethan]]. He seems excited at the proposition and after asking a few questions was off to pack his things and meet the crew later on at [[pier 6]] where [[Old Dorothy]] and their new warship was docked.

[[Captain Estefin Swill|Estefin]] and [[Don Maishell|Don]] then head to [[pier 4]] in search of more potential members when they spot [[Keith]] who had recently aged out of [[Mother Sue's Orphanage for wayward children]], and was now working as a dockhand and apprentice shipwright.

After getting his attention the crew was able to persuade him with some coin and promise of a higher pay rate than his current position, he eagerly accepted unaware he had just signed up for a pirate crew. Upon asking [[Keith]] if he had anyone else who might be interested he mentioned someone named [[Old Derrick]], but seemed hesitant for some reason. However the crew said to bring him along and [[Keith]] set off to quit his job, recruit [[Old Derrick]], and meet the crew at [[pier 6]].

In their last attempt to find more suitable members they headed to the local sheriffs office in an attempt to free some criminals as payment for coming aboard. After talking to a number of the prisoners through magical messaging outside the prison walls, they landed on a potential member who called himself [[Tooth]]. Upon asking the front desk a few questions as to the nature of [[Tooth]]'s crime and sentencing. It was revealed he had been locked up for drunken disorderly conduct and punching a dog in the face.

[[Captain Estefin Swill|Captain Swill]] and [[Don Maishell|Don]] are particularly troubled by the dog punching part and head back outside to message [[Tooth]] again to question him further about this.  

[[Tooth]] admits to having punched the dog but claims it was self defense and the dog started biting him out of no where. After a quick insight by the gang it appears he's telling the truth. The crew then quickly post his bail after a short discussion about no future dog punching. [[Captain Estefin Swill|the Captain]] and [[Don Maishell|Don]] begin head back to [[pier 6]] to meet with [[Tik' Nik']] and their new recruits, while [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] continues to rest below deck.
