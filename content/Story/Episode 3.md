We begin with everyone arriving to [[pier 6]] where [[Tik' Nik']] and [[Merri Lightningbolt|Merri]] are fishing and resting respectively. The first arrival is actually [[Young Ethan]] followed shortly by [[Captain Estefin Swill|Captain Swill]], [[Don Maishell|Don]], and their newest crew member [[Tooth]]. The party gets [[Young Ethan]] situated with his sleeping quarters and is told he is to hide should danger ever show itself.

Soon after [[Keith]] arrives pushing along an elderly man in a metal chair on wheels. Keith introduces the man as [[Old Derrick]] and begins wheeling him onto the crew's new vessel upon realizing he's boarding what appears to be a marine warship, and that he might have gotten himself into a lot more than he planned for at his new job.

The crew realized it might be best to try to hide any evidence and fully repair/paint the ship as best they can to remove any marine or world government markings, though still not many people are sailing around on large warships.

The crew travels into town for a quick shopping mission for wood, nails and general supplies for repairs and painting along with [[Keith|Keith's]] aid, then promptly head back to the ship to begin repairs. [[Don Maishell|Don]] mentions it might be a good idea to head to the job board at [[pier 4]] and see if there's any work that could get them out of the area for a bit while there's still time and [[The Marines|the marines]] haven't started poking around yet.

[[Captain Estefin Swill|Estefin]] agrees and the two of them head that way. Upon arriving at the job board and looking over a couple of jobs they found one for looking for a larger shipping vessel to deliver and had an address listed at the bottom.

Upon heading to the address listed they were greeted by a young female receptionist who called in her boss. He mentioned that the job would be to transport a large piece of cargo to a government research island called [[Isle Rose]]. The job would pay 500 gold for successful completion of the mission. He also mentioned due to a heavy workload they were a bit behind but would deliver the cargo to their ship by 8pm that night or first thing in the morning.

Don expressed his concern for visiting a government island so soon after their recent encounter with [[The Marines|the marines]], especially with a marine vessel as their current ship. Though [[Captain Estefin Swill|the Captain]] eases his concerns by assuring [[Don Maishell|Don]] that as long as they hide the ship thing's should be ok as currently no one lived to tell the tale, as well their vessel is being painted as they speak. As well they can't hide from [[The Marines|the marines]] forever as they were pirates anyways. And though [[Don Maishell|Don]] still has his concerns this message resonates with him as he trusts his captain and is also easily swayed.

After accepting the job offer and signing the necessary paperwork the two were headed back to their ship to prepare for the coming journey and see to the rest of the repairs and painting.

Late that night the cargo arrived and was loaded aboard the new warship, before the crew took their rest's aside from the unsleeping [[Tik' Nik']] fishing through the night.

The next morning our crew awakens and begins the finishing touches on getting the vessel painted before heading out to [[Isle Rose]]. The crew made it a few day's outside the island before nearly having a run in with a massive tentacled creature, though luckily the crew swiftly jumped into action removing them from any danger before it was too late.

With danger recently evaded and several days travel left to go, though the wind at their backs the crew
