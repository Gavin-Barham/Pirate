A couple weeks before the start of our campaign orders came down from [[The Fleet Admiral]] to newly appointed [[Vice Admiral Shiro]] only a few day's after his promotion from Captain. His first orders as Vice Admiral involved heading to a remote island somewhere in the middle of [[The North Blue]] called [[Six Piers Island]] to retrieve a devil fruit that was discovered there by a local farmer. The specifics of the fruit itself were not revealed to [[Vice Admiral Shiro|Shiro]], just that he was to bring it back to [[Marine HQ]].
