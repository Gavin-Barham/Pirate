Resurrection and True Resurrection is a lost spell to time outside of a single individual being the oldest living being. However Revivify and Resurrection are available to learn they are extremely difficult to come across someone who knows them, much less outside of a [[The World Government|World Government]] facility where the use of spell craft wouldn't be forbidden.

Those with the rank of Vice Admiral are granted a singular resurrection we that with or without a body. Upon receiving the Vice Admiral rank you are informed of this for the first time and are told that should you take the offer and have you soul return to this world, the rest of your days will be spent in service of [[The Marines||the marines]] and the [[The World Government|World Government]] or be put at rest as swiftly as they were brought back.

Those with the rank of Admiral and Fleet Admiral are returned as many times as necessary until their duties have been fulfilled or they have been replaced.
