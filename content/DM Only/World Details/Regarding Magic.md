Magic is not as common in this world as most high fantasy settings. Not that is is not prevalent, but that in it is strictly prohibited in [[The World Government]] affiliated territories by all non government personnel. Even then only some of the highest ranking members of [[The Marines]], Rulers of said territories, and [[The Noble Families]] are permitted without question. Violators will be met swiftly with violent justice.
