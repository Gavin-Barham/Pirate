A small pirate group formed in the North Blue led by their captain, [[Captain Estefin Swill]] and a couple of his adoptive brothers from [[Mother Sue's Orphanage for wayward children]], [[Tik' Nik']] and [[Don Maishell]], as well as a cheery sea elf in search of an escape from his past commitments [[Merri Lightningbolt]].

The crew later recruited additional members [[Keith]] as general deckhand and shipwright, [[Young Ethan]] as a cabin boy, and [[Old Derrick]] for his years of wisdom.
