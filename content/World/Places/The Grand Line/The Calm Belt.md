A name given to two stretches of ocean that run parallel to [[The Grand Line]] and act as a barrier on either side. The calm belt is said to be home to thousands of massive sea beast, and supposedly it gets its name from the fact that there are no weather events including wind or waves and the water is said to appear almost glass like due to its unmoving nature.
