Reverse Mountain is a strange natural phenomena that inhibits entry into the grand line. The Mountain itself is split in five locations, one for each of the four blues and one for [[The Grand Line]]. These splits in the mountain are filled by fast moving waterfalls if you can even call them that, since the water here flows in reverse. The mouth leading to each of the 4 blues flow upwards against the will of gravity and run together with a single waterfall flowing normally and its mouth leading into [[The Grand Line]].
