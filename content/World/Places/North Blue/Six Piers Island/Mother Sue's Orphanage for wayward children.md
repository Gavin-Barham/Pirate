A small orphanage on the west bank of [[Six Piers Island]], located near [[pier 6]]. The orphanage is run by none other than [[Mother Sue]]. However she is not alone in her efforts, as a few of the children who've aged out of foster care now live and work as caregivers and helpers to Mother Sue at the orphanage. These include [[Miss Lalahn]], [[Miss Trahl]], and [[Miss Eve]]. This is also the home of 3 of our protagonists [[Captain Estefin Swill]], [[Tik' Nik']], and [[Don Maishell]].
