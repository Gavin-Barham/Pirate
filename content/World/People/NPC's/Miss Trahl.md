Description:
	An middle aged human woman of age 38, She has short black hair with a bit of a bob cut, and glasses. Unlike her mother [[Mother Sue]], she gives off a much colder vibe on the surface, though to the children of the orphanage she shows love and kindness much like [[Mother Sue]].

Miss Tristan Trahl was the first orphan to ever come to [[Mother Sue's Orphanage for wayward children]] before it's conception, when she was found by [[Mother Sue]] crying from inside a waste bin.

Though she was the first she didn't grow up lonely, as by the time she was 3-4 she was surrounded by adoptive siblings. Being the oldest she quickly learned from watching her mother with the other children what it meant to be a caretaker. By the time she was a teenager she was spending almost all her time helping [[Mother Sue]] around the orphanage and upon aging out decided to stay and work full time for her mother.
