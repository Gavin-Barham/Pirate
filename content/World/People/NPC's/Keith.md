A tall well built human man 19 years old. Grew up at [[Mother Sue's Orphanage for wayward children]], and upon aging out began working as a dockworker and a novice shipwright. He was recruited by [[Don Maishell]] and [[Captain Estefin Swill]] to join [[The Swill Shell Pirates]] under the guise of being a shipping crew, and only after joining did he learn of his new role as a pirate crewman.
