description:
A tall blond teifling with a tight bun. A strong willed motherly figure who's not afraid to discipline some kids. She stands at around 5'8" and is 32 years of age.

Miss Calandra Eve is the main disciplinarian at [[Mother Sue's Orphanage for wayward children]]. Though her role as a disciplinarian often puts her at odd's with many of the children, she holds a warm place in her heart for each of them, though the stern expression and large wooden paddle might fool you.
